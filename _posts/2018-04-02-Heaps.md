## Definition:

Heaps are a binary tree with a structural property in which all heaps are a complete binary tree (when coded we dont use linked lists with left and right pointers, rather we trace through an array and manipulating the array as if it was a complete binary tree. Heaps also must also have all of its nodes in a specific order, following the heap order property. <br>

What makes a heap, a heap? Firstly, ask yourself this 

```mermaid
graph TD
A(Is the tree <b>*</b>complete?);
A -->|Yes| B(Are the root's children >= it, a minheap, or <= it, a maxheap?);
A -->|No| C[not a heap];
B -->|Yes| D[ heap yeah!];
B -->|No| E[ not at heap];

```
* All of the levels of the tree must be filled completely except maybe the last one. <br>
    |> must have the **left-most** nodes **always** filled.
